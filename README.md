# PDF TABLE TO CSV
Does as it says.
Uses camelot-py as backend.
This attempts to smooth out the csv file combination if there are multiple pages.

Should be available under the name tableflip on pypi.
Currently, under a short development time(not available).


It does what it's supposed to do with some manual intervention. But that's what this project is attempting to change.
